        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using various features such as age, flight distance, inflight entertainment, and service quality. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we analyze the data to build a predictive model that estimates customer satisfaction levels based on these factors.

        <p>
            The objective of this project is to predict insurance charges based on various factors using machine
            learning models. We will employ Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to build and evaluate our
            predictive models. The factors considered for prediction include age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of
            children, smoking status, and region.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            We used a variety of machine learning algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. 
            After testing and validating these models, we selected the best-performing model for our predictions.
        </p>
        <h2>Algorithm</h2>
        <h6> A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression
            tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a
            tree-like structure of decisions. Each node in the tree represents a feature, each branch represents a
            decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome. Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize,
            but they can be prone to overfitting, especially with complex datasets.</h6>
        <h6>  Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to produce a more robust
            and accurate model. It works by creating multiple Decision Trees during training and outputting the mean
            prediction (regression) or mode prediction (classification) of the individual trees. Random Forest reduces
            the risk of overfitting and improves generalization by averaging the results of many trees, each trained on
            different subsets of the data.</h6>
    
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            The final model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.85, indicating a strong correlation between the predicted and actual prices.
            This model can be used to provide reliable estimates for classification based on input features.
